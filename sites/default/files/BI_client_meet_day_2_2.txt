BI Client Members KT session : 23rd May 2017

Topic:- Dev Site spin Up Process
1. They felt that the process takes more time
2. Suggested use of settings.php for common as well as specific versions(e.g. settings.local.php, settings.dev.php etc.) and set variables to decrease the load on variables.conf 
3. A cleanup is needed to remove deprecated functionality.

Topic:- Brightcove 
1. max upload size for brightcove videos is less(10MB). Deep suggested It can be changed by editing the max_upload_size at server level or site level
2. brightcove media player is not responsive. It can be possible with proper theming or updates that come in contrib module for brightcove.


Topic:- BI Disclaimer message
1. needed the message popup window to support HTML. Since the requirement was for an alert box, it was a plain message box.


Topic:- Adverse Event Reports
1.User must come to know which words he has used are adverse/improper in the pop-up message.
2. there can be a way to track adverse event by anonymous users through their IP address. 
3. Deep suggested a hub component for making note of all adverse event records and configuration settings for the same.


Topic:- Hubconfig component
1. Some sites still rely on hubcore config settings to configure the VEEVA CRM on spbth
2. Deep explained the use of hubconfig to avoid blocking the veeva vault account in case of incorrect password.


Topic:- Veeva Vault
1. If veeva account gets blocked, the account owner can get a notification email. Deep suggested a user story for this in JIRA.
2. Mattias suggested an increase in number of veeva vault accounts to make sure SPBTH is always connected to the veeva vault.
3. Raul needs a diagrammatic representation of VEEVA vault API workflow for previous and current state(with and without hubconfig).

***Raul needs a list of add-ons and corresponding confluence page links for the topics that were covered on Day 2.***
