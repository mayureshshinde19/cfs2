JIRA Tickets to be created :-

1. Hubtagging in client(SPBTH) uses drop down menu links to enable and sync  taxonomy terms. Buttons can be used instead to achieve this functionality.

2. Vocabularies in master(hubtagging) should be auto synced to all existing content types. Currently we have to create new content type to sync the updated changes from master to client.

3. Need a good UI on hubtaglog for better view of logs/reports.

4. Need to redesign URL shortening so that it may not require site token, page token

5. clean up the deprecated features(already present in backlog)

5. Remove old dashbaord from hubcore(already present in backlog)

6. Redesign hubcore dashboard(more presentable and UI friendly).

7. If a Veeva vault account gets disabled, account holder must get notification regarding the same.
